# FAQ

From the spritely freshman to the seasoned senior, we all have questions to ask. Here are some that have common answers:
<ul class="q-a">
  <li>Where is the Physics Department?</li>
  <li>We are located on the <strong>8th through 10th floors</strong> in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/LtWXX9H9Yw12"><strong>726 Broadway</strong></a>. Up until May 2017, we were located in Meyer Hall, but now the Psychology & Neuroscience Department has sole possession of that building.</li>
  <li>Where do physics people hang out?</li>
  <li>We're peppered around a few places in 726 Broadway. The social epicenter of the physics undergraduates is <strong>Room 1014</strong>, right across from the administration offices.</li>
  <li>When and where are SPS meetings?</li>
  <li>We meet <strong>every Thursday at 7PM</strong>. Since the full meetings would overrun Room 1014, we will be meeting in <strong>Room 1067</strong>, a <a href="http://as.nyu.edu/physics/research/center-for-quantum-phenomena.html">CQP</a> conference room.</li>
  <li>Do I have to be a physics major to join SPS or attend an SPS meeting?</li>
  <li>Absolutely not! We like hearing stuff from all different walks of life. Just keep in mind: we are a bunch of <span style="text-decoration:line-through">nerds</span> peeps who enjoy math-y things, so there is bound to be a plethora of mathematics referenced in our meetings. The only requirement to attend our meetings is that <strong>you must be affiliated with NYU, i.e. a student, faculty, staff, or alumni member</strong>.</li>
</ul>
